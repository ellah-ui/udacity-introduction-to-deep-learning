##  MNIST Classification Project

Inside the `Handwritten Digits Classifier with Pytorch Project/` directory, you'll discover:
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Using PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to fetch and prepare data.
- **Model Architectures**: Comparison of a baseline Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieves better accuracy.
- **Training Workflow**: Custom training loops with real-time monitoring of loss and accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Testing performance and analyzing output.
- **Model Persistence**: Saving (`torch.save`) and loading trained models.

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ellah-ui/udacity-introduction-to-deep-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project:

   ```bash
   cd udacity-introduction-to-deep-learning/"Handwritten Digits Classifier with Pytorch Project"
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
   ```

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Work through the notebook to explore data, train models, and track performance.
